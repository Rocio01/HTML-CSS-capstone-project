# HTML-CSS-capstone-project (based on an online shop for electronics)

> 
This is a project for the HTML & CSS capstone project: Online shop for electronics (https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX).
The Project is based on an online shop for electronics. I personalized the content, instead of a shop of electronics I built a page for the adoption of pets.
In this task I was required to create a responsive page using the best practices of HTML AND CSS with GitHub process flow.
